 * PROBLEM: Fruits Into Baskets II
 * PLATFORM: LeetCode
 * DIFFICULTY: Easy
 * LEETCODE URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/fruits-into-baskets-ii/
 * * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
 * You are given two arrays of integers, fruits and baskets, each of length n, where fruits[i] represents the quantity of the ith type of fruit, and baskets[j] represents the capacity of the jth basket.

From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:

	Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or equal to the quantity of that fruit type.
	Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.
	If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.

Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.
 * * APPROACH:
 * Solved using Array to optimize the approach.
 * Topics: Array, Binary Search, Segment Tree, Simulation, Ordered Set
